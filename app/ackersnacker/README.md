# ackersnacker

Finished Project of Team ackersnacker for the #WirvsVirus Hackathon.
To use, you need to generate a Google API key for use of Maps and Geocoder SDKs and place it in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` as well as `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` at the specified positions.
Also, server data have to be transferred from and to a server using the backend in [the backend repository](https://github.com/LSnyd/ackersnackerAPI). For that, the URL to the server needs to be placed in `lib/pages/BauerPage.dart` and `lib/pages/MapPage.dart` at the specified positions.

A compiled APK to test the App with a usable API key and running server will be provided shortly.
